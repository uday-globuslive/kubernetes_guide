- Job scheduling and management
- Resource allocation strategies
- Parallel processing
- Workflow orchestration
- Data handling for batch jobs
- Monitoring and logging
- Failure handling

## Implementation Examples
- Kubernetes Jobs and CronJobs
- Argo Workflows for complex pipelines
- Apache Spark on Kubernetes
- ETL processing pipelines
