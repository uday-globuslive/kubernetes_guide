# IoT Backend on Kubernetes

## Introduction
This project demonstrates building a scalable and reliable IoT backend infrastructure on Kubernetes, handling device connections, data ingestion, processing, and analytics.

## Topics Covered
- IoT architecture patterns
- Message brokers for IoT
- Data ingestion pipelines
- Device management
- Real-time processing
- Data storage strategies
- Analytics infrastructure
- Edge-cloud communication

## Implementation Examples
- MQTT broker deployment (Mosquitto, EMQ)
- Kafka streams for data processing
- Time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
- Device registry services
- Stream processing with Flink
- Edge computing with K3s

## Best Practices
- Scalability considerations
- Security for device communication
- Data retention policies
- Resource allocation strategies
- High availability configuration
- Fault tolerance design
- Monitoring IoT-specific metrics
