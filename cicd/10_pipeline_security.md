## Introduction to Pipeline Security

CI/CD pipelines have become the backbone of modern software delivery. However, they also represent a significant attack surface that could be exploited to inject malicious code, steal secrets, or compromise production environments. Pipeline security focuses on protecting the entire delivery process from development to deployment.

### Why Pipeline Security Matters

- **Privileged Access**: CI/CD pipelines often have elevated permissions to production environments
- **Single Point of Compromise**: A compromised pipeline can affect all downstream systems
- **Attractive Target**: Attackers target CI/CD to achieve persistence in applications
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Pipeline compromises can lead to software supply chain attacks
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Many compliance standards now address pipeline security

### Security Shift Left Principle

```

└────────────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘
       ▲              ▲              ▲               ▲               ▲
       │              │              │               │               │
       └──────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘
                             Security Integration
```

Implementing security early in the development lifecycle (shifting left) is more effective and less costly than addressing security issues after deployment.

## Common Security Risks

### OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks

1. **Insufficient Flow Control Mechanisms**: Lack of proper checks and approvals
2. **Inadequate Identity Management**: Weak authentication and authorization
3. **Dependency Chain Abuse**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies
4. **Poisoned Pipeline Execution**: Executing untrusted code in pipelines
5. **Insufficient PBAC (Pipeline-Based Access Controls)**: Overprivileged pipelines
6. **Insufficient Credential Hygiene**: Improper storage and handling of secrets
7. **Insecure System Configuration**: Misconfigured CI/CD systems
8. **Ungoverned Usage of 3rd Party Services**: Insecure integration with external services
9. **Improper Artifact Integrity Validation**: Lack of validation for built artifacts
10. **Insufficient Logging and Visibility**: Inadequate monitoring and auditing

### Attack Vectors

- **Compromised Developer Accounts**: Attackers gain access to developer credentials
- **Malicious Pull Requests**: Injecting harmful code through seemingly legitimate PRs
- **Dependency Confusion**: Exploiting package name confusion to introduce malicious packages
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromising upstream dependencies
- **Insider Threats**: Malicious actions by authorized team members
- **Infrastructure Attacks**: Targeting the underlying CI/CD infrastructure

## Securing the CI/CD Infrastructure

### Kubernetes Cluster Hardening

```yaml
# Example: PodSecurityPolicy for CI/CD workloads
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: cicd-restricted
spec:
  privileged: false
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  requiredDropCapabilities:
    - ALL
  volumes:
    - 'configMap'
    - 'emptyDir'
    - 'projected'
    - 'secret'
    - 'downwardAPI'
    - 'persistentVolumeClaim'
  hostNetwork: false
  hostIPC: false
  hostPID: false
  runAsUser:
    rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
  seLinux:
    rule: 'RunAsAny'
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: 'MustRunAs'
    ranges:
      - min: 1
        max: 65535
  fsGroup:
    rule: 'MustRunAs'
    ranges:
      - min: 1
        max: 65535
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

### Network Security

- **Network Policies**: Limit communication between CI/CD components
- **Service Mesh**: Secure service-to-service communication
- **Ingress Protection**: Secure external access to CI/CD tools

```yaml
# Example: Network Policy for CI/CD components
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: cicd-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: ci-system
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: ci-system
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: artifact-registry
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
```

### Builder Security

- **Ephemeral Builders**: Use single-use, ephemeral build environments
- **Minimal Builder Images**: Use minimal, purpose-built images for builders
- **Isolated Build Networks**: Isolate build environments from production
- **Reproducible Builds**: Ensure build process is deterministic and reproducible

## Secrets Management

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Hardcoded secrets in scripts or code
- Storing secrets in environment variables
- Including secrets in container images
- Storing secrets in plain text configuration files
- Storing secrets in git repositories (even private ones)

### Kubernetes Secrets

```yaml
# Example: Secret for pipeline credentials
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pipeline-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  registry-username: <base64-encoded-value>
  registry-password: <base64-encoded-value>
  api-key: <base64-encoded-value>
```

```yaml
# Example: Using secrets in a Pod
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pipeline-runner
spec:
  containers:
  - name: builder
    image: builder:latest
    env:
    - name: REGISTRY_USERNAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: pipeline-credentials
          key: registry-username
    - name: REGISTRY_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: pipeline-credentials
          key: registry-password
```

### External Secret Management

#### HashiCorp Vault Integration

```yaml
# Example: Vault Agent Injector
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cicd-deployment
  labels:
    app: cicd
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cicd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cicd
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-database-creds: "database/creds/cicd-role"
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: "cicd-role"
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: cicd-service-account
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:latest
```

#### AWS Secrets Manager

```yaml
# Example: Using External Secrets Operator with AWS Secrets Manager
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: cicd-secrets
spec:
  refreshInterval: "15m"
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secretsmanager
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: pipeline-secrets
  data:
  - secretKey: api-key
    remoteRef:
      key: cicd/api-keys
      property: api-key
  - secretKey: registry-credentials
    remoteRef:
      key: cicd/registry
      property: credentials
```

### Short-lived Credentials

- **Service Account Tokens**: Use short-lived tokens bound to specific service accounts
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Generate temporary credentials for each pipeline run
- **Role Assumption**: Use temporary role assumption (like AWS STS)

### Just-In-Time Access

- **On-demand Secrets**: Provision secrets only when needed
- **Time-bound Access**: Limit secret access to specific time windows
- **Context-aware Access**: Grant access based on runtime context

## Code and Dependency Security

### Secure Code Management

- **Branch Protection**: Prevent direct commits to protected branches
- **Signed Commits**: Require cryptographic signatures for commits
- **Code Reviews**: Enforce minimum number of reviews before merging
- **Automated Code Scanning**: Run static analysis tools on all code changes

#### GitHub Branch Protection Example

```json
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": [
      "ci/jenkins/build",
      "security/code-scan"
    ]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
    "require_code_owner_reviews": true,
    "required_approving_review_count": 2
  },
  "restrictions": {
    "users": [],
    "teams": ["devops-team"]
  },
  "required_linear_history": true,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
```

### Dependency Management

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automatically scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**: Generate and validate SBOMs for all artifacts
- **Dependency Pinning**: Pin dependencies to specific versions
- **Verified Dependencies**: Use only verified and trusted dependencies

#### Dependency Scanning in CI Pipeline

```yaml
# Example: Dependency scanning in GitHub Actions
name: Dependency Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Run Dependency Scan
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        scan-type: 'fs'
        scan-ref: '.'
        format: 'sarif'
        output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
        severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    
    - name: Upload Scan Results
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

### Dependency Confusion Protection

- **Private Registries**: Use private registries for internal packages
- **Package Namespace Reservation**: Reserve package names in public registries
- **Dependency Firewall**: Validate all dependencies against an allowlist

## Container Image Security

### Image Building

- **Minimal Base Images**: Use slim or distroless images
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime environments
- **No Secrets in Images**: Never include secrets in container images
- **User Permissions**: Run containers as non-root users

```dockerfile
# Example: Multi-stage build with non-root user
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
USER 1000
CMD ["dist/server.js"]
```

### Image Scanning

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan images for known vulnerabilities
- **Malware Scanning**: Check for malicious code
- **Configuration Checks**: Validate image configurations against best practices
- **License Compliance**: Ensure all components comply with licensing requirements

```yaml
# Example: Image scanning in Tekton Pipeline
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: image-scan
spec:
  params:
    - name: image-url
      type: string
  steps:
    - name: scan
      image: aquasec/trivy:latest
      args:
        - "image"
        - "--severity"
        - "HIGH,CRITICAL"
        - "--exit-code"
        - "1"
        - "$(params.image-url)"
```

### Image Signing and Verification

- **Content Trust**: Sign images during build
- **Signature Verification**: Verify signatures before deployment
- **Attestations**: Include attestations about build process and scan results

```yaml
# Example: Cosign image signing in GitHub Actions
jobs:
  sign:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install cosign
        uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@main
      
      - name: Login to registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Sign image
        run: |
          cosign sign --key cosign.key \
            ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

### Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)

- **SLSA Level 1**: Documented build process
- **SLSA Level 2**: Tamper resistance of build service
- **SLSA Level 3**: Source and build platform security controls
- **SLSA Level 4**: Hermetic builds and two-person reviews

## Infrastructure as Code Security

  stage: security
  image: bridgecrew/checkov:latest
  script:
    - checkov -d terraform/ --output cli --output junitxml > checkov-report.xml
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: checkov-report.xml
```

### Secure Defaults

      sast: gl-sast-report.json

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:3.16
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache curl
  script:
    - curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOY_TOKEN" https://deploy.example.com/api/deploy
  environment:
    name: production
  when: manual
  only:
    - main
```

### ArgoCD Security

- **SSO Integration**: Use enterprise SSO
- **RBAC Configuration**: Configure fine-grained RBAC
- **Repo Validation**: Validate Git repositories
- **Diffing and Syncing**: Review changes before syncing

```yaml
# Example: ArgoCD RBAC Configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-rbac-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  policy.csv: |
    p, role:deployment-viewer, applications, get, */*, allow
    p, role:deployment-admin, applications, *, */*, allow
